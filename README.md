# PantryBuddy
This repository is a backup of our Java app, which was developed as a group project at Java course at Uni. The main goal of the app is to help users cook meals basing on which products they have in their kitchen's pantry.

The original repostiry is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/sebastian-botero-leonik/zpoif_2024_zespol_1/src/main/).
